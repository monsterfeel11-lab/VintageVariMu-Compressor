✅ User Controls

This MetaSound compressor exposes all essential parameters at the top-level MetaSound Source, allowing users to directly adjust the behavior of the processor in real time.
The layout is designed to mimic the workflow of the original Fairchild 660 front-panel, giving intuitive access to input stage behavior, compression intensity, time-constant modes, and tone shaping.

1) USER CONTROL SECTION

These parameters control the input stage and the fundamental timing behavior of the compressor.

Input Gain

Adjusts the level feeding into the tube amplification stage.
Driving the input harder increases the amount of compression, enhances the Vari-Mu curvature, and introduces stronger analog-style saturation and transformer coloration.

Threshold (dB)

Defines the level at which gain reduction begins.
Lower threshold = stronger compression.
Higher threshold = lighter, more transparent compression.

Time Constant Mode (1–6)

Recreates the six program-dependent release profiles of the Fairchild 660.
Each mode blends fast and slow release curves with different time scales, producing musical and natural dynamic behavior that reacts to program material.

2) TONE & DYNAMIC CONTROL SECTION

These controls allow fine adjustment of tone, dynamic shape, and modern mixing options such as parallel compression.

Ratio

Sets the base compression intensity.
In a Vari-Mu system, the effective ratio increases dynamically as the input level rises, and this parameter defines the foundational strength of that curve.

Knee (dB)

Controls how smoothly the signal transitions into compression.
0 dB = hard knee,
Higher values (e.g., 6–12 dB) = softer, more vintage-style knee.

Makeup Gain (dB)

Adds gain after compression to compensate for level reduction.
It also interacts subtly with the output transformer coloration since the final gain stage influences saturation amount.

Parallel Mix (Dry/Wet)

Blends the uncompressed (dry) signal with the compressed (wet) signal.
This enables true parallel compression directly inside MetaSound without the need for additional routing.

📌 Additional Notes on User Controls

All parameters are exposed at the MetaSound Source level, meaning they can be adjusted in Audio Components, Blueprints, Sequencer, or any runtime system supporting MetaSound parameters.

Controls are organized into two intuitive groups —
User Control (Input & Timing) and Tone & Dynamic Control — mirroring the logical workflow of the original hardware.

Input Gain and Time Constant Mode influence not just the threshold, but also the tube behavior, release curves, and saturation characteristics, just as they would in the real Vari-mu comp.
