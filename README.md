📘 VARI-MU COMP METASOUND PATCH
Vintage Tube Compressor Reconstruction inside Unreal MetaSound

Version: 1.0.0
Author: KANG

📝 Overview

This MetaSound pack recreates the behavior of a vintage Fairchild-style vari-mu tube compressor by modeling the functional behavior of its analog components using MetaSound nodes.

The system simulates:

Input Transformer coloring & gain staging

6386 Variable-Mu Tube Amplification (compression curve + saturation)

Program-Dependent Time Constant Network (6-mode release characteristic)

Output Transformer tone shaping

Detector / Control Voltage Path (envelope behavior)

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how MetaSound can be used not only for DSP-style processing, but also to rebuild analog audio hardware behaviors inside the Unreal Engine audio ecosystem.

🧩 Features
✔ Reconstructed Analog Behavior

Modeled from the key building blocks of the Fairchild 660 compressor:

Input Transformer (T1)
Adds musical pre-coloration & interacts with Input Gain

6386 Mu-Variable Tube Stage
Emulates increasing compression ratio as level rises (vari-mu curve)

Sidechain Detector
Peak/RMS behavior, smoothing, knee calculation

Program-Dependent Time Constant Network
Switchable 1–6 modes with automatic fast/slow release blending

Output Transformer Coloring
Subtle harmonic warmth using waveshapers and gain staging

✔ Full User-Controllable Interface

Exposed parameters allow real-time control just like the hardware front panel.

✔ Soft/Hard Knee, Parallel Mix, Makeup Gain

Modern workflow features added while preserving vintage behavior.

✔ 100% MetaSound Native

No external DSP libraries required. Works in UE 5.3+.

🎛 Analog Component → MetaSound Mapping


Analog Component	Function in Hardware	MetaSound Patch Equivalent
Input Transformer (T1)	Impedance matching, saturation, pre-emphasis	MP_INPUT / InputGain_dB × DecibelsToLinearGain
PAD / Input Gain Network	Adjust incoming level before tube	INPUT_GAIN_DB parameter controlling gain staging
6386 Variable-Mu Tubes	Level-dependent gain reduction, rising ratio	MP_VARIMU gain computer (vari-mu curve, knee, GR mapping)
Sidechain Rectifier	Converts audio to control voltage	MP_DETECTOR (Peak/RMS smoothing, envelope follower)
Time Constant Network (Mode 1–6)	Program-dependent release (dual time)	MP_TIMECONST + MP_TIMECONST_MODE_TABLE
Output Tube + Transformer	Final tone shaping, harmonic coloration	MP_COLOR (waveshaper + transformer-like soft saturation)
🧭 Patch Architecture

The full compressor is composed of modular MetaSound patches:

MP_FC660 (Main Source)
│
├── MP_INPUT                // Input transformer, gain staging
├── MP_DETECTOR             // Peak/RMS envelope + smoothing
├── MP_TIMECONST            // Fast/Slow release blending
├── MP_TIMECONST_MODE_TABLE // Mode 1–6 preset values
├── MP_VARIMU               // Vari-mu gain computer
├── MP_COLOR                // Output saturation / transformer tone
└── MP_OUTPUT               // Final linear output


Each component can be opened and studied individually to understand how analog behavior is reconstructed using MetaSound nodes.

🎚 User-Adjustable Parameters

Input Gain (dB)

Controls how hard the signal hits the tube stage.
Acts like the PAD/Pre-gain of the real Fairchild.

Threshold (dB)

Level at which compression begins.
Lower threshold = more compression.

Ratio

Controls base compression intensity.
Internally multiplied by the vari-mu curve to mimic tube behavior.

Knee (dB)

Softens the transition into compression.
0 dB = hard knee, 6–12 dB = soft vintage knee.

Time Constant Mode (1–6)

Recreates the Fairchild’s 6 release profiles.
Each mode blends fast and slow release components.

Makeup Gain (dB)

Restores gain lost during compression.

Mix (Dry/Wet)

Allows parallel compression.

Color Amount

Controls the level of output transformer/tube saturation.

🛠 Installation

Copy the FC660_MetaSound folder into your project:
YourProject/Content/MetaSound/FC660/

Open the MetaSound Source MS_FC660_Compressor.

Use it like any other MetaSound effect:

WavePlayer → MS_FC660 → Output

🕹 Usage Example

Add an Audio Component to your Actor.

Assign a Wave Asset.

Replace the output MetaSound with MS_FC660_Compressor.

Adjust:

Input Gain

Threshold

Time Constant Mode

Ratio / Knee / Mix

Play and listen to vari-mu compression inside Unreal.

🧪 Technical Notes

Linear gain factors always clamped to avoid positive GR.

Knee and Ratio computations follow variable-mu behavior.

Time Mode derives from lookup table + MapRange interpolation.

Built for UE 5.3–5.4 MetaSound architecture.

Zero external dependencies.

🐞 Troubleshooting

No compression happening

Check input gain level

Ensure detector path connected

Verify threshold < source level

Audio gets louder when knee = 0

Knee minimum is clamped internally

Ensure GR_dB stays ≤ 0

TimeConstant not changing

Mode table must be connected to MP_TIMECONST
